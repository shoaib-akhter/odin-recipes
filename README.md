# odin-recipes

Welcome to my Odin Recipes project, created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. This project marks my first step into the world of web development, where I learned to build a simple yet functional recipe website using HTML.

## Overview

This project focuses on the basics of HTML, including:
- Structuring content with headings, paragraphs, and lists.
- Creating links to navigate between pages.
- Embedding images to make the recipes visually appealing.
