    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk (adjust as needed for consistency)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        <li>Butter or oil for greasing the pan</li>
        <li>Toppings (optional): Fresh fruits, syrup, butter, powdered sugar, whipped cream, or chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. This ensures the leavening agents are evenly distributed for fluffy pancakes.</li>
        
        <li> <strong>Mix the Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl or a large measuring jug, combine the milk, egg, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth and well combined.</li>

        <li> <strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients.</li>
                <li>Gently whisk until the batter is smooth and there are no large lumps, but avoid overmixing (a few small lumps are okay). If the batter feels too thick, add a tablespoon or two of milk to thin it slightly.</li>
                              
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Preheat and Grease the Pan:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Lightly grease it with butter or oil, using a paper towel to spread evenly.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Cook the Pancakes:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Use the back of a spoon to spread the batter slightly if needed.</li>
                <li>Cook until small bubbles appear on the surface and the edges look set, about 2 - 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Flip the pancake gently with a spatula and cook the other side for 1 - 2 minutes until golden brown.</li>                
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Repeat and Keep Warm:</strong> Transfer cooked pancakes to a plate and cover them with a clean kitchen towel or foil to keep warm. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, greasing the pan as needed.</li>

        <li> <strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Stack the warm pancakes on plates.</li>
                <li>Add your favorite toppings like syrup, fruits, or powdered sugar.</li>                
            </ol>
        </li>

    </ol>

    <p>These light and fluffy pancakes are best enjoyed fresh and warm. Share them with someone special for a delightful breakfast!</p>
