    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium-sized ripe tomatoes (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 small onion (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove (minced)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable or chicken stock (adjust for desired consistency)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream (optional, for creaminess)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves (a few, for garnish)</li>
        <li>Croutons or bread (optional, for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Tomatoes:</strong> Wash and chop the tomatoes into small pieces. If you prefer a smoother soup, you can blanch and peel them first (place tomatoes in boiling water for 30 seconds, then transfer to ice water, and peel off the skins).</li>
        
        <li> <strong>Sauté the Base:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil or butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and cook for 2 - 3 minutes until softened and translucent.</li>
                <li>Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>                
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Cook the Tomatoes:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the chopped tomatoes to the saucepan. Stir well to combine with the onion and garlic.</li>
                <li>Cover and let the tomatoes cook down for about 5 - 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they become soft and release their juices.</li>
                              
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Add Stock and Simmer:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour in the vegetable or chicken stock and stir.</li>
                <li>Season with salt, black pepper, and sugar (if needed to reduce the acidity).</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.</li>                
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Blend the Soup:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and allow it to cool slightly.</li>
                <li>Use an immersion blender to puree the soup directly in the pot. Alternatively, transfer the mixture to a blender and blend until smooth (work in batches if necessary).</li>
                <li>If using a blender, return the soup to the pot.</li>                
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Adjust Consistency and Flavor:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt or pepper if needed.</li>
                <li>For a creamier texture, stir in the heavy cream and heat gently without boiling.</li>
                                
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Serve and Garnish:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Ladle the hot soup into bowls.</li>
                <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of cream (if desired).</li>
                <li>Serve with croutons or crusty bread on the side for dipping.</li>                
            </ol>
        </li>

    </ol>
