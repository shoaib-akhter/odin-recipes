    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat the Pan:</strong> Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Sauté the Base:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and cook for 2 - 3 minutes until softened.</li>
                <li>Stir in the diced bell pepper and cook for another 4 - 5 minutes until the vegetables are tender.</li>
                              
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Add Garlic and Spices:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the minced garlic, paprika, cumin, and chili flakes (if using).</li>
                <li>Cook for about 1 minute, stirring frequently, until fragrant.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Prepare the Tomato Sauce:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the diced tomatoes (or canned tomatoes) and tomato paste to the skillet.</li>
                <li>Stir well to combine, then season with salt and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 8 - 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.</li>                
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Create Wells for the Eggs:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Use a spoon to make two small wells in the sauce.</li>
                <li>Crack one egg into each well, being careful not to break the yolks.</li>                
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Cook the Eggs:</strong> Cover the skillet with a lid and cook on low heat for 5 - 7 minutes, or until the egg whites are set but the yolks remain runny (or cook longer for firmer yolks).</li>

        <li> <strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the skillet from heat and garnish the shakshuka with fresh parsley or cilantro.</li>
                <li>Serve directly from the pan with crusty bread or pita for dipping.</li>
                
            </ol>
        </li>

    </ol>
